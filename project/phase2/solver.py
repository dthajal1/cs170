## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
# given a list of n igloos to polish with id i, deadline t_i in minutes, duration d_i in minutes, and profit p_i, 
# provide a sequence of igloos to polish in one day (1440 minutes) that would maximize the total profit.

## CONSTRAINTS
# 1. start scheduling polishing tasks at the 0th minute of the day.

# 2. start the next polishing task at the same minute we finish the previous polishing task

# 3. We receive whole profit for tasks that complete any time before or on their deadline. 
# ex. if a task has d=5 and t=10, we get the whole profit p if we schedule it at any time before minute 5
# (including at minute 5) because it would complete by minute 10. 
# If we schedule this task at minute 6, we would
# complete it by minute 11, and gain profit corresponding to completing the task 1 minute late.
# late profit = p_i * e ** (âˆ’0.0170 * s_i)
# s_i = number of mins late

# 4. We can schedule tasks such that the last task completes by minute 1440, 
# For example, we can schedule a task with duration 1 at minute 1439 since it would complete by minute 1440




## DP APPROACH
# Hints for DP Heuristics (assumes additional constraints that will make the problem easier to solve)
# 1. assume late tasks have 0 payoffs (for simplicity) ---- ignore for now

# 2. Another example of a DP heuristic you could make is  ------ use this
#               you could assume that tasks are always completed in order of id 
#               (so 1 2 5 6 12 is a valid schedule, but 1 5 2 6 12 is not). 
#               Then, you could design algorithm similar to knapsack around this assumption.


# Parameters: n, i, t_i, d_i, p_i
# Sub Problem:
# f(i, T) = max total profit we can gain amonst tasks[i....n] before minute T

# want: f(1, 1440)

# Recurrence Relation
# i = current igloo, T = # of mins available
# f(i, T) = 
# {
#             (no more igloos left to polish)
#             0,             if i == n + 1   
# 
#             (cannot be finished before 1440 so we can't polish this igloo)
#             f(i + 1, T)    if d_i > T (maybe d_i >= T)? 
# 
#             (otherwise) -- this also handles the case where later tasks have earlier deadline (if the late profit is still positive it will polish it otherwise, it won't polish it)
#             (if we can polish the igloo, we take maximum of polishing the igloo or not polishing the igloo)
#             max{ 
#                   f(i + 1, T)     ----- don't polish the igloo
#                   p_i + f(i + 1, T - d_i)    ------ polish the igloo
#               }           
# }
